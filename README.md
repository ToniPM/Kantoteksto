An (as of yet unfinished) app for learning languages through repetition by means of song lyrics. This is being done largely because of personal interest, because as far as I can tell there is no decent free alternative out there. It is also a project to familiarize myself with android development, particularly Kotlin.

This project was started as an entry for a Huawei-sponsored contest, though it probably won't be finished like one due to time constraints. How this turns out will color some important facets of the app - for instance, whether it will be feasible to use STT and translation to generate lyrics for each song depends almost entirely on whether the relevant HMS kits will be available, or the existence of reliable alternatives.
